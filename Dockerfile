# NOTE: As of 2021-07-14, Alpine 3.11, 3.13 and 3.14 suffer from a bug in
# busybox[0] that affects busybox's nslookup implementation. Under certain
# conditions that typically depend on `/etc/resolv.conf` configuration,
# nslookup returns with exit code 1 instead of 0 even when the given name is
# resolved successfully. More information about the bug can be found on this
# thread[1].
