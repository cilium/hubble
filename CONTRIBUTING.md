# Contributing to Hubble

## Contribution workflow

Hubble uses GitHub for collaborative development. Note that this repository
only hosts release artifacts for Hubble CLI. The actual code for Hubble CLI
is in [Cilium GitHub repository] under [`hubble/` directory](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/tree/main/hubble).
Please use GitHub issues to discuss proposals and use pull requests to suggest
changes in [Cilium GitHub repository].

For more information see the [Cilium Development
Guide](https://docs.cilium.io/en/latest/contributing/development/) and the
[Hubble-specific
notes](https://docs.cilium.io/en/latest/contributing/development/hubble/).

## Slack

Most Hubble developers are using Slack to communicate outside of GitHub. Join
the `#sig-hubble` channel on
[Cilium Slack](https://cilium.slack.com/archives/CQRL25N0N).
